**Project Name: Flappy Bird Clone in Python**

**Description:**
Welcome to the Flappy Bird Clone project in Python! This repository hosts a faithful recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python programming. The game captures the essence of the original while offering a customizable and extensible codebase that can serve as a foundation for further game development learning.

**Features:**
- **Classic Gameplay:** Experience the addictive gameplay of Flappy Bird, where you control a bird's flight through a series of pipes by tapping the screen (or pressing a key).

- **Realistic Physics:** The game incorporates simple yet realistic physics, providing a challenging and engaging user experience.

- **Customization:** The project structure is designed to be easily customizable. You can adjust parameters such as pipe spacing, bird dynamics, and screen layout to create your unique version of the game.

- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of your score, incrementing it whenever you successfully navigate the bird through a set of pipes.

- **Game Over and Restart:** When the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game displays a game over screen and allows you to restart the game with a single keystroke.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-python.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd flappy-bird-python`
4. Run the game: `python flappy_bird.py`
5. Use the spacebar key to control the bird's flight, and try to navigate through the pipes.
